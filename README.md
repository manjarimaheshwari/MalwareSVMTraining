# MalwareSVMTraining
Utilized Hidden Markov Models and Support Vector Machines to classify 3 Malware Families (WinWebSec, Zbot, and ZeroAccess) in Java

Wrangled pure data from each malware family by translating 3,000 files of opcodes to ascii characters and then to numbers to train 9 HMM’s (3 Models per family). 
Selected appropriate tuning parameters, such as testing maximum of 50,000 characters, and 4 different kernels (Linear, Polynomial, Radial Basis, and Sigmoid) to train 3 SVM’s total using 3 HMM’s per family.
Conducted 24 experiments, of which 8 hit 100% testing accuracy and a total of 12  were above 98.5%.
